# VLSI-Project series ADC 
layout and schematic

Implementation of an entire series ADC from the CMOS inverter.
Every design was done by its layout & schematic implementation. 
every part of the design was simulated and tested by the DRC for proper behavior.
The project was done using the Electrical IDE and LTSpice.
