ADC series layout and schematic

I implemented an entire series ADC from the first CMOS inverter in this project.
every single item designed in its layout and schematic implementation.
for example, the frequency divider created by concatenating D-FF, also in schematic and layout designs. 
every single part was simulated and had DRC for proper behavior.
The whole project has been done by the Electrical IDE.
